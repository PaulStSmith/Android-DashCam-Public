## 1. About This Policy

DashCam is developed by **ByteForge** to help users turn an Android phone into a simple, reliable dashboard camera.  
This Privacy Policy explains what information DashCam collects, how itâ€™s used, and how you remain in control of your data.

DashCam is designed with privacy in mind. It does **not** collect personal information, display ads, or send analytics data to any third party.

---

## 2. Information We Collect and Store

DashCam only accesses the data it needs to function properly. All data is stored **locally on your device** or on a **destination you choose**.

| **Camera & Microphone**                                     | To record video and audio while driving.                                        | Saved as MP4 files on your phone or SD card.                                  |
| **Location (GPS)**                                          | To record route, speed, and heading.                                            | Stored locally in `.srt` and `.gpx` files.                                    |
| **Motion Sensors (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer)** | To detect impacts and provide telemetry logs.                                   | Saved locally in `.csv` files.                                                |
| **Network Access**                                          | Used only for uploads that you configure (SMB/CIFS, Google Drive, or OneDrive). | Sent directly to your selected server; never stored or transmitted elsewhere. |

DashCam does **not**:
- Send recordings or logs to any ByteForge server.  
- Include advertising, analytics, or tracking tools.  
- Collect names, email addresses, or any other personal identifiers.

## 3. How Your Data Is Used

Your data exists solely to make DashCam work:

- **Video, audio, and telemetry** files are recorded for your own use (evidence, travel history, or personal logs).  
- **Uploads**, if enabled, are sent only to the network share or cloud account you configure.  
- DashCam never views, analyzes, or shares your data with anyone else.

---

## 4. Data Sharing

DashCam does not share your data with ByteForge or any third party.  
If you choose to upload files, they are transferred directly to your configured server or cloud account using your own credentials.

---

## 5. Security

- All sensitive credentials (such as SMB usernames and passwords) are encrypted and stored securely using the [Android Keystore](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore).  
- DashCam never stores or transmits this information outside your device.  
- Files are accessible only through your deviceâ€™s file manager or the network share you define.

---

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

- All recordings remain on your device until you delete them or enable **auto-delete after upload**.  
- Uninstalling DashCam removes its internal storage files but not those youâ€™ve saved elsewhere.  
- You can delete any file at any time using your deviceâ€™s file manager or cloud interface.
